# Interdisciplinary-Contest-In-Modeling
1. We begin with the quantitative analysis of present demand from the perspective of number of traditional and electric vehicles. Then we make use of the Queuing Model to figure out the relationship between the expected waiting time and arrival rate so as to predict the amount of charging stations with reasonable adjustment.
2. I builded a basic model, referring to the **Vitali's Covering Theorem**.
3. A **linear regression** model was used to predict the number of electric vehicles in the future.
4. Take the dominant factor in the differences between countries into account and establish a Population/Income/Geographic-led Model.
6. This paper was awarded the **Honorable Mention in ICM**.
